# Pic Me- A Portable PhotoBooth

A React-based web app that allows users to create personalized Polaroid-style photos. It lets users take a photo, customize it with frames and stickers, and download the final image easily.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of PicMe were to:

- Develop a web application that allows users to create personalized Polaroid-style photos.
- Enable users capture photos directly in the app.
- Provide customization options, including adding frames and stickers.
- Allow users to preview and edit their designs before finalizing them.
- Give users the ability to download the customized Polaroid photo easily.

## Technologies Used

- Git & GitHub – for version control and project collaboration.
- React – as the core framework for building the web application and managing UI components.
- JavaScript, HTML, and CSS – for functionality, structure, and styling.
- Konva – to enable editing and manipulation of images, frames, and stickers on a canvas.
- html2canvas – to capture the final design and export it as a downloadable image.

## User Interface

The PicMe interface was designed in Figma, with a focus on creating a visually appealing and intuitive experience. I wanted the UI to follow a retro-game style, giving the app a playful and nostalgic feel.

Interactive elements like buttons, frames, and stickers were designed to be clear and user-friendly, making it easy for users to customize and download their Polaroid-style photos.

The following are screenshots of the design on figma:
